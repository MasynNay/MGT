## User Story

As a parent looking for a safe and engaging environment for my child to learn gymnastics, I want to explore the Mother Goose Tumbling website to find information about available classes, competition details, and team opportunities, so that I can make an informed decision about enrolling my child in the program. The website should be easy to navigate, visually appealing, and provide all the necessary details, including schedules, coach bios, and contact information, to ensure I feel confident in choosing the right program for my child.
